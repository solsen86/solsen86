                                I have moved from DataTables to Bootstrap-Table for my table structure and functionality. I haven't been loving it so much,
                                but it has filtering in the column headers and is easier to work with. However, if I want fixed headers I need to give it a static
                                height on the page. I don't feel that is very responsive and have been looking for alternatives.   
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text">
                                I might have to build my own table so I can make my filters and functions work the way I want them to. I just couldn't get 
                                DataTables to work correctly with my CSV file upload when using SearchPanes. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That brings me to my happy thought! I got my CSV file to upload to multiple tables correctly. The data loads quickly
                                and correctly.

                                Work continues on on the inventory project. I keep finding new things I want to change on the back end as I develop the front end.
                                But I have my inventory table working with sorting, pagination and searching. Thanks to <a href="https://datatables.net/">datatables.net</a>!

                                I'm liking how this is starting to shape up. But it is taking longer than I would like. I guess that is the price you pay when
                                you try designing an inventory system alone, while also working full time in IT.

                                For the last couple of weeks I have been working on designing an asset management system to track our inventory of IT assets at the School District. It has been almost two years since I have worked with SQL or an RDBMS like MySQL. It has been fun, stressful and rewarding.

                                I'm sure it isn't perfect, but it works for what I need. I'm sure I'll be working on it and refining it further. But I'm proud of what I have set up. I have user authentication working and now all I need to do is work on the front-end for the inventory system.

                                Last week, when we went to Bonners Ferry, ID for Spring Break, we went on a hike to see the Kootenai Falls and the Swinging Bridge. It was a little muddy, but it was warm and the sky was clear. As we approached the bridge my son and his cousin ran off ahead of the group. We couldn't see them anywhere. As a parent, surrounded by tall cliffs and a swift river, I was more than a little stressed. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text">
                                When we got to the bridge I saw them 100 feet down by the riverbank. It took me almost 20 minutes to find a way to hike down to them. When I go there they had removed their socks and shoes and were climbing around in the rocks and wading through a small runoff stream. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text">
                                After watching them enjoy themselves in the carefree ignorance of youth, my anxiousness started to melt away. Of course, what kind of a parent would I be if I didn't talk to them about wilderness safety and group etiquette? However, once the unpleasantness was over, I looked around and had a chance to take a deep breath and enjoy my surroundings. I snapped a couple of pictures on my cell phone and hiked back up to the rest of the group. 
                            </p>
