                                Last week, when we went to Bonners Ferry, ID for Spring Break, we went on a hike to see the Kootenai Falls and the Swinging Bridge. It was a little muddy, but it was warm and the sky was clear. As we approached the bridge my son and his cousin ran off ahead of the group. We couldn't see them anywhere. As a parent, surrounded by tall cliffs and a swift river, I was more than a little stressed.

                            <p class="card-text">
                                When we got to the bridge I saw them 100 feet down by the riverbank. It took me almost 20 minutes to find a way to hike down to them. When I go there they had removed their socks and shoes and were climbing around in the rocks and wading through a small runoff stream.

                            <p class="card-text">
                                After watching them enjoy themselves in the carefree ignorance of youth, my anxiousness started to melt away. Of course, what kind of a parent would I be if I didn't talk to them about wilderness safety and group etiquette? However, once the unpleasantness was over, I looked around and had a chance to take a deep breath and enjoy my surroundings. I snapped a couple of pictures on my cell phone and hiked back up to the rest of the group.
